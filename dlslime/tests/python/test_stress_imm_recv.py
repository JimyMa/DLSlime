"""Stress test for writeWithImm + immRecv matching.

The refactor's most behaviorally-changed path is ``imm_recv``. Before,
ImmRecvFuture read completion fields off a transport-owned slot whose
memory could be recycled under it. After the refactor, each user
``immRecv()`` allocates a stable ``EndpointOpState``; the endpoint
matches arriving WRITE_WITH_IMM completions against either
``pending_imm_recv_ops_`` (user already waiting) or queues them in
``completed_imm_recv_events_`` (write landed first). This test
exercises both sides of that match, plus the interleaved case, and
verifies every ``imm_data`` value lands at exactly one future.

Three modes:

    * pre_post   — every immRecv() is posted BEFORE any writeWithImm.
                   Forces the pending-ops path on arrival.
    * post_first — every writeWithImm lands BEFORE any immRecv() call.
                   Forces the completed-events queue path.
    * interleaved — alternating submissions. Both paths at once.
