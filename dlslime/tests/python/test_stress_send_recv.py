"""Stress tests for send/recv slot reuse after the PR #70 refactor.

What this verifies
------------------
The pre-refactor code reused SendContext / RecvContext slots via
``counter % DEPTH``. That left two failure modes on the two-sided path:

1. A slot could be re-leased to op B while op A's data-send callback
   was still in flight, so the CQE for op A's WR would dispatch into
   op B's callback (op A's future hangs, op B's future completes
   early — "cross-wiring").
2. A slot's per-op transport state (``meta_arrived_flag_``,
   ``remote_meta_info_``, …) could be stomped by a later op while the
   previous op's WRs were still outstanding.

After the refactor a slot leaves ``send_free_ring_`` / ``recv_free_ring_``
on acquire and returns only after every per-qp data-path callback for
its current tenant has fired. So:

* slot-release-on-complete must actually fire (I2 in
  ``docs/endpoint-ownership-model.md``) — otherwise the free ring
  drains and the (DEPTH+1)-th op blocks forever on acquire;
* the callback for op A must deliver completion to op A's
  ``EndpointOpState`` — otherwise the recv buffer for op A would end
  up with the wrong bytes.

Two tests:

* ``test_sequential_slot_churn``    — one pair at a time, many rounds.
  Exercises pure slot reuse; the simplest shape that would have
  tripped the pre-refactor ABA hazard.
* ``test_concurrent_matched_order`` — N concurrent pairs per round,
  both sides pairing in the same relative order. This is the correct
  concurrency contract for two-sided send/recv (see "API contract —
  pair ordering" in docs/endpoint-ownership-model.md). IBRC FIFO
  plus the free-slot ring guarantee that sender slot-k is matched
  with receiver slot-k throughout the lifetime of the connection,
  so no cross-wiring can occur. A cross-wire here would be either a
  refactor regression or a protocol regression.

    Two failure modes this catches:

    * If ``releaseSendSlot`` / ``releaseRecvSlot`` is not called on
      the final per-qp callback, the free ring drains and the
      (DEPTH+1)-th op hangs forever in ``acquireSendSlot`` /
      ``acquireRecvSlot``. The test would time out.

    * If a stale callback from a previous op were still bound to the
      slot's assigns (the pre-refactor ABA hazard), the reused op
      would see the previous op's completion fire into its
      ``EndpointOpState``, and either hang (if the old op wrote
