<h2 align="center"> Composable and Embeddable Communication Runtime for AI Services </h2>

DLSlime is a PeerAgent-centered communication and microservice toolkit for
distributed AI systems. PeerAgent is the runtime hub: application services such
as SlimeRPC and DLSlimeCache build on it, NanoCtrl supplies service governance
and coordination metadata around it, and endpoint APIs below it drive
heterogeneous transports such as RDMA, TCP, NVLink, and Ascend Direct.

DLSlime is designed to be adopted one layer at a time. Applications can start
with direct endpoints, add PeerAgent coordination, use NanoCtrl for governance,
or build on SlimeRPC and DLSlimeCache when they need service-shaped components.
The same layers are exposed as Python/C++ APIs, local services, and HTTP
control-plane contracts, so DLSlime can be embedded into existing serving,
inference, cache, or RL systems instead of replacing them.

## PeerAgent-Centered Architecture

DLSlime is organized around PeerAgent. Application services attach to
PeerAgent, NanoCtrl provides service governance and coordination metadata, and
endpoint APIs drive the underlying transfer engines and devices. The diagram
below shows these layers without requiring applications to bind themselves to one
transport or topology.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/imgs/dlslime_arch.png" alt="DLSlime PeerAgent-centered architecture" width="92%">
</p>

## How The Layers Work Together

1. A service starts and registers itself with NanoCtrl as a generic entity, for
   example `kind=cache` or `kind=rpc-worker`.
2. Each service attaches to a PeerAgent instead of managing transport state
   directly.
3. PeerAgents register their resource records and memory regions with NanoCtrl.
4. Clients discover services by `kind` and scope, then reach the service through
   its PeerAgent.
5. PeerAgents exchange connection intent and memory-region metadata through
   NanoCtrl/Redis.
6. Endpoint objects issue the actual transfer through RDMA, NVLink, Ascend
   Direct, or the selected backend.

## Usage Scenarios

### Direct Endpoint Access

Use the Endpoint API directly when the application already controls peer
placement, metadata exchange, and memory lifetime. This is the lowest-level path
through DLSlime: it avoids NanoCtrl and PeerAgent, and maps application transfer
logic straight onto endpoint-to-endpoint data movement.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/imgs/endpoint2endpoint.png" alt="Direct endpoint-to-endpoint access" width="88%">
</p>

Typical examples are two-process RDMA read/write tests, NVLink transfer checks,
and backend bring-up where explicit setup is more useful than service discovery.

Example: [p2p_rdma_rc_read.py](dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_read.py),
[p2p_rdma_rc_write.py](dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_write.py),
[p2p_nvlink.py](dlslime/examples/python/p2p_nvlink.py), and
[p2p_ascend_read.py](dlslime/examples/python/p2p_ascend_read.py).

```bash
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_read.py
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_write.py
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_write_with_imm_data.py
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_send_recv_gdr.py
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 dlslime/examples/python/p2p_nvlink.py
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_ascend_read.py
```

Ascend Direct setup details live in
[docs/huawei_ascend/README.md](docs/huawei_ascend/README.md).

### TCP Fallback Transport

Use TCP when the hosts have no RDMA NICs or when a peer connection has to
traverse a network without RDMA capability. The TCP transport exposes the same
primitives — `endpoint_info` / `connect`, two-sided `send` / `recv`, one-sided
`read` / `write`, and named memory regions — and plugs into PeerAgent through
the same control plane via `connect_to(transport="tcp")`. Immediate-data ops
(`write_with_imm`, `imm_recv`) are RDMA-only and raise `NotImplementedError`
on TCP.

`BUILD_TCP` is `ON` by default.

Raw `TcpEndpoint`, no NanoCtrl required:

```bash
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_tcp_rc_send_recv.py
```

PeerAgent over TCP:

```bash
nanoctrl start
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_tcp_send_recv_peer_agent.py
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_tcp_rc_write_peer_agent.py
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_tcp_rc_read_peer_agent.py
```

See [docs/src/guide/tcp-transport.md](docs/src/guide/tcp-transport.md) for the
full surface, one-sided I/O setup, and the test reference.

### PeerAgent-to-PeerAgent Access

Use PeerAgent when the application wants peer-to-peer data movement without
managing connection setup, memory-region discovery, and stale-state cleanup by
itself. Each process owns a PeerAgent, registers its resources through NanoCtrl,
and then uses the PeerAgent facade to read or write remote memory through the
selected endpoint.

This path keeps the same endpoint data plane as direct access, but moves
coordination into NanoCtrl and PeerAgent. It is the right starting point for
multi-process services, dynamic peer discovery, and higher-level components such
as SlimeRPC and DLSlimeCache.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/imgs/peer2peer.png" alt="PeerAgent-to-PeerAgent access" width="88%">
</p>

Example:
[p2p_rdma_rc_read_ctrl_plane.py](dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_read_ctrl_plane.py)
and
[p2p_rdma_multi_agents_ctrl_plane.py](dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_multi_agents_ctrl_plane.py).

```bash
nanoctrl start
python dlslime/examples/python/p2p_rdma_rc_read_ctrl_plane.py
```

### DLSlimeCache Service

Use DLSlimeCache when multiple PeerAgent clients need a shared RDMA-backed cache
service. PeerAgent A and PeerAgent B discover the Cache Service through
NanoCtrl, fetch cache assignment metadata from the service, and then read or
write cache slabs through the same PeerAgent and endpoint data plane.

In this path, NanoCtrl keeps the Cache Service discoverable as a registered
service, the Cache Service owns the cache memory region and assignment
manifests, and PeerAgent clients perform the data movement without embedding
cache placement logic into each application process.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/imgs/cacheService.png" alt="DLSlimeCache service access" width="88%">
</p>

Example: [cache_client_example.py](dlslime/examples/python/cache_client_example.py) and
[dlslime-cache design](docs/design/dlslime-cache.md).

```bash
nanoctrl start
dlslime-cache start --ctrl http://127.0.0.1:4479 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --memory-size 1G

python dlslime/examples/python/cache_client_example.py --url http://127.0.0.1:8765

dlslime-cache stop
```

### SlimeRPC Service

Use SlimeRPC when application logic should call a Python service while keeping
the transport and peer coordination inside DLSlime. A client process uses a
SlimeRPC proxy on top of its PeerAgent, the service process serves Python
methods through a SlimeRPC server on top of its own PeerAgent, and NanoCtrl keeps
the RPC service discoverable.

RPC request and response messages are carried by the PeerAgent transport rather
than the control plane. This keeps service invocation at the application layer
while reusing the same PeerAgent, endpoint, and mailbox data path as lower-level
peer-to-peer flows.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/imgs/slimeRPC.png" alt="SlimeRPC service access" width="88%">
</p>

Example: [rpc_example.py](dlslime/examples/python/rpc_example.py) and
[rpc_flatbuf_example.py](dlslime/examples/python/rpc_flatbuf_example.py).

```bash
nanoctrl start
python dlslime/examples/python/rpc_example.py --ctrl http://127.0.0.1:4479
```

### Disaggregated Inference Service

Use DLSlime for disaggregated inference when prefill and decode run as separate
serving roles. This follows the same pattern used by LMDeploy DistServe:
a proxy routes requests to dedicated Prefill and Decode workers, Prefill
computes prompt KV cache, Decode generates tokens, and a migration/data-plane
backend transfers KV cache between the two roles.

In DLSlime terms, each Prefill or Decode worker can be modeled as a service with
its own PeerAgent. NanoCtrl keeps the worker roles discoverable by `kind`, stores
resource and memory metadata for the PeerAgents, and lets the serving proxy or
workers build the required prefill-to-decode connections. The KV cache transfer
then uses the PeerAgent and endpoint data plane instead of going through the
control plane.
